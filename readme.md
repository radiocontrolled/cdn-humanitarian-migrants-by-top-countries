# About 
This visualisation looks at the number humanitarian migrants who come to Canada by top source countries. It is based on the Statistics Canada report, <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/facts2012/temporary/19.asp">Canada â€“ Total entries of humanitarian population by top source countries</a>.

# Roadmap 
- Label X access
- Create tooltips for the bars, hiding the text indicating the population number (until shown on hover)
- Make it so bars transition between years
- Make bars sortable

# Background
