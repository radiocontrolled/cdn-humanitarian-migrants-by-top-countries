# About 
This visualisation looks humanitarian migrants who come to Canada by top source countries. According to Statistics Canada "source country" refers to a person's place of last residence. 

This work is based on the report <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/facts2012/temporary/19.asp">Canada â€“ Total entries of humanitarian population by top source countries</a>. 
This is **version 1** and <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/radiocontrolled/7722907">second in a series</a> on visualising migration.

See <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/3/">Mike Bostock's</a> bar chart tutorial.
